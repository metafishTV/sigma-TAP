Unificity = Unity + Multiplicity

A unificity is real thing. Only virtual things can be either a pure multiplicity or a pure unity; both are impossible, only unificities are possible.

A unificity is equivalent to A. Koestler's holon, & includes Delleuze & Guatarri's rhizome & assemblage. Every unity is a rhizome, every assemblage is a multiplicity -- BUT ->

	every multiplicity is a unity of at least one;
	 every unity is a multiplicity of at least two;
	 the unific modality is equivalent to Sarte's third-party.

Unificity is an irreducible modality distinct from unity & multiplicity, just as the latter two are irreducible modalities to each other.

	 Unificity is the modality of contex
	  Unity is the modality of things
	   Multiplicity is the modality of sets of things
	 
	 Total configuration space = 1,
		BUT -> the unific modality is always the most actualized, being the  consummation of the combinatorial consumption of the unities (things) & the multiplicities (sets of things),
			AND -> each modality is a 1' to the total configuration space.
